I made this quiz as mmy final projetc of a 6 week course called the Tech Talent Accelerator (TTA). Which has taught me the basics of coding which prior to it I had very litte knowledge of.

I think this project shows good use of CSS following the box model and javascript as I learnt a little bit about Jquery a Javascript library which I wasn't taught on the course.
